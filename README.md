Basically, i want to write a external radar by render the player position into a vritual map.
### But
It seems you can't get the POS data from the memory real-time. Because the m_originVec only shows the data when player visible, and the Game Server send you the POS data only when player visible to you.

### So
When there is another way, I will continue.
